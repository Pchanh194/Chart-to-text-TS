        "The `stats_to_e2e_source` function formats HVAC statistics into a string suitable for end-to-end (e2e) source data representation, incorporating both operational type (e.g., operating or non-operating hours) and optional summary information. The function takes three parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `stats`: A dictionary where each key represents a data type (e.g., `fan_stat`, temperature statistics) and each value is another dictionary containing specific statistics for that data type (average, minimum, maximum, outside setpoint percentage).\n",
