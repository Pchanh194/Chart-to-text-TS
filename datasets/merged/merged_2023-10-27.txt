For example, from 2023/10/27 00:20:08 to 2023/10/27 00:40:08, from 2023/10/27 01:20:08 to 2023/10/27 01:40:08, from 2023/10/27 02:20:08 to 2023/10/27 02:40:08, and intermittently throughout the data. These extended periods where the attribute remains at -1.0 may indicate anomalies or issues with the fan operation. Additionally, the attribute fluctuates between 0.0 and -1.0, which could be an indication of inconsistent or irregular fan behavior. It's important to investigate these anomalies to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system and to maintain the desired setpoint range for the environment.
Based on the data provided, there are anomalies in the states of the fan_stat_G-02 attribute. The anomalies are indicated by the values of -1.0 and 1.0, which are outside the expected 0 or 1 states for this attribute. These anomalies persist over various time intervals, with consecutive instances of -1.0 or 1.0 occurring for several consecutive data points. Such anomalies may signify irregular behavior in the system, suggesting potential issues or fluctuations in the operation of the attribute. It is essential to investigate these anomalies further to identify the root cause and ensure the attribute operates within the expected state range.

The fan status should typically be either 0 or 1, indicating off or on states, respectively. However, there are instances where the value is -1, indicating an anomalous state. These anomalies persist for varying durations, ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours 40 minutes. The prolonged periods of anomalies could indicate potential issues with the equipment or irregularities in the data collection process. It's essential to investigate and address these anomalies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data.
There are several anomalies in the data for the fan status attribute (fan_stat_G-04). Throughout the recorded period, the attribute value stays at 0.0 for a prolonged duration, indicating that the fan status did not change during those times. Additionally, there are instances where the attribute value is -1.0, which suggests a potential anomaly or unexpected behavior of the fan. However, it is important to note that the data does not encompass the entire setpoint range, and therefore, further investigation and additional data are required to provide a comprehensive analysis of anomalies related to the fan status.

Anomalies in the data are quite evident. The attribute "fan_stat_G-07" showcases a pattern of alternating between 0 and -1 frequently, with a few transitions to 1 in the mix as well. This behavior can be considered anomalous as it deviates significantly from the usual setpoint range of 0 or 1 for such attributes. The anomaly persists for considerable durations, with instances of the attribute being out of the expected setpoint range for extended periods, undermining the system's efficiency and potentially indicating underlying issues in the fan's operation. These anomalies should be further investigated to identify the root cause and ensure the proper functioning of the fan.
Based on the provided data, several anomalies can be observed in the attribute "fan_stat_G-08." The anomalies primarily involve the attribute taking on values outside the expected setpoint range of 0 or 1. Specifically, there are significant periods where the attribute remains at -1.0, indicating an unexpected state for an extended duration. These instances occur at multiple timestamps, such as 2023/10/27-00:20:08, 2023/10/27-01:20:08, 2023/10/27-02:20:08, and so on. The extended duration of these anomalies suggests a potential issue with the fan_stat_G-08 attribute, indicating a deviation from the expected behavior. Further investigation or assessment of the system may be necessary to address and rectify these anomalies and restore the attribute to its intended operating state within the desired setpoint range of 0 or 1.
The data shows anomalies in the fan status attribute (fan_stat_L1-07), with irregularities in the timestamps for specific value changes. Notably, there are instances where the fan status is recorded as -1.0, suggesting a potential malfunction or an abnormal state. The anomalies persist for varying durations, with some occurrences lasting for extended periods, while others change relatively quickly. These anomalies may indicate potential issues with the fan or its control system, requiring further investigation to ensure proper functionality and system stability.
There are several anomalies in the provided data for fan_stat_L1-06. The attribute remains at -1.0, which indicates an abnormal state, for extended periods at various timestamps throughout the day. These periods range from 20 minutes to 1 hour, which surpasses the expected range of 20-24 degrees Celsius for the temperature setpoint. Such prolonged periods of abnormal states may indicate a potential issue with the fan operation or temperature control system. It's essential to investigate the root cause of these anomalies to ensure proper functionality and maintain an optimal operating environment.
The provided data shows the status of a fan at different timestamps. Anomalies can be observed in the data where the status of the fan goes beyond the expected range. For instance, at 2023/10/27-00:20:08 and 2023/10/27-00:50:08, the fan status is registered as -1.0, which is outside the expected binary range of 0 or 1. Similarly, in multiple instances such as 2023/10/27-03:40:08, 2023/10/27-04:40:08, 2023/10/27-05:40:08, 2023/10/27-06:40:08, and others, the status of the fan fluctuates between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating inconsistent behavior. Furthermore, at 2023/10/27-07:00:08, the fan status changes to 1.0, which is also unexpected. These anomalies highlight irregularities in the fan's status, indicating potential issues in its operation or in the data recording process.
The data shows anomalies in the behavior of the fan status attribute (fan_stat_L1-04) on October 27, 2023. The attribute remains at -1.0 for prolonged periods, indicating a potentially malfunctioning fan or a fault in the data recording process. The fan status should ideally fluctuate between 0.0 and 1.0 as it turns on and off to maintain a stable environment. The anomaly seems to last for long periods with consistent -1.0 readings, which may require investigation into potential equipment failures or data collection issues. Such prolonged anomalies could adversely affect the environment's temperature control and energy consumption, highlighting the significance of promptly addressing issues to ensure operational efficiency.
Upon analyzing the data, it is evident that there are anomalies in the fan_stat_L1-03 attribute. Specifically, the fan_stat_L1-03 attribute shows variations outside the normal setpoint range of -1 to 1, with multiple instances of -1 and 1, indicating a deviation from the expected operating states.

These prolonged periods of anomalous behavior may warrant further investigation to ensure optimal performance and operational efficiency.
From the provided data on the status of a fan (fan_stat_L1-02), it appears that there are several anomalies present. Firstly, the value of -1.0 seems to indicate an issue or anomaly within the system, as it deviates from the expected status value, which would typically be either 0.0 or 1.0. These anomalies of -1.0 persist for varying durations, spanning from a few minutes to an hour throughout the day. Furthermore, the fan status remains unchanged at 0.0 for extended periods, which could indicate potential issues with the fan's operation. It's important to investigate and address these anomalies to ensure the optimal functioning of the fan and the system it supports.
The fan status data exhibits anomalies with significant duration. From 00:20:08 to 00:30:08 and from 01:20:08 to 01:30:08, the fan status abruptly drops to -1.0, signaling an anomalous state. Similarly, from 02:20:08 to 02:30:08 and from 03:20:08 to 03:30:08, the fan status again behaves anomalously, dropping to -1.0 before returning to 0.0. These anomalies persist from 04:40:08 to 05:00:09 and from 05:40:08 to 06:00:08, followed by a continuous 1.0 status from 06:20:08 to 09:40:08, then from 10:40:08 to 13:40:08, and finally from 14:40:08 to 17:40:08. The recurring anomalies indicate a potential issue in the fan system's performance, warranting a thorough inspection to identify root causes and rectify the irregular behavior.
