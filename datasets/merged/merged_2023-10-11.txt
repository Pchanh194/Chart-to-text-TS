It is unusual for the fan to remain off for such an extended period, and it may indicate a potential anomaly or issue with the cooling system. It is essential to check if the fan is functioning as expected and whether there are any underlying factors causing it to remain in this state without any changes. Further investigation is recommended to ensure the cooling system's reliability and efficiency.
The data shows a consistent state of 0 for the attribute "fan_stat_G-08" throughout the day on October 11, 2023. This anomaly indicates that the fan status remained unchanged, with no instances of the fan being activated or reaching a state of 1. The attribute's prolonged duration outside of the expected setpoint range suggests a potential issue with the fan or a lack of variation in the data. It's important to investigate further to determine whether this prolonged inactivity is expected or if there may be an underlying problem with the fan system.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-07" remained at a constant value of 0 throughout the entire period from 12:54:42 to 17:53:20 on October 11, 2023. This extended duration of consistent values could indicate a potential anomaly in the data. It is unusual for the attribute to stay unchanged for such a substantial period, which may warrant further investigation to determine if there was a technical issue, sensor malfunction, or a genuine sustained state of the system. Analyzing the context and surrounding data points could provide valuable insights into the anomaly and any underlying causes.
The data from 2023/10/11 displays a consistent state of '0' for the fan_stat_L1-06 attribute, indicating that the fan status remains unchanged throughout the recorded time. This prolonged period of inactivity or consistent state might indicate an anomaly or potential issue with the fan, as it remains inactive for an extended duration from 12:54:42 to 17:53:20. It's essential to investigate the cause of this extended period of inactivity to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system and address any potential anomalies in the data.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-05" remains at a constant state of 0 across multiple timestamps, indicating no change in the status of the fan. This anomaly persists for several hours, from 12:54:42 to 17:53:20 on October 11th, 2023, resulting in an extended period where the fan status is consistently at 0 without any fluctuations. Such prolonged instances of inactivity may require further investigation to ensure that the fan is functioning as expected and to assess if any abnormalities or malfunctions have occurred during this time period.
The data shows consistent fan status (1) from 12:54:42 to 17:53:20 on October 11, 2023. However, a significant anomaly occurs at 17:53:20, where the fan status abruptly changes to 0, indicating a potential malfunction or manual intervention. This anomaly persists until the end of the dataset. The fan status is out of the expected setpoint range for 1 hour and 39 minutes, which may require investigation to identify the cause of the deviation from the normal operating state.
The data shows a consistent state of the fan_stat_L1-03 attribute, with a value of 1, for an extended period from 12:54:42 on October 11th, 2023, until 17:53:20 on the same day. This prolonged duration of the attribute maintaining the same state without any change or variation could indicate a potential anomaly. While it's common for certain attributes to remain steady for periods, this extended duration outside the usual variability might warrant further investigation to ensure the system's proper functioning and to address any potential issues. Regarding temperature, the provided data does not include relevant information for assessing anomalies in temperature.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-02" maintained a consistent state of 1 from 12:54:42 to 17:53:20 on October 11, 2023. This prolonged period of consistent state without any change could indicate a potential anomaly in the system. Such extended periods of unchanging states may warrant further investigation to ensure that the equipment is functioning as intended. It's important to monitor and identify any anomalies in the data to maintain the efficiency and reliability of the system.
The data reveals a continuous state of 1 for the fan_stat_L1-01 attribute from 2023/10/11 12:54:42 until 2023/10/11 17:53:20, indicating that the fan remained operational without any observed changes in its state. This prolonged period of consistent data may indicate either a lack of sensor sensitivity to detect any fluctuations or a potential anomaly in the data capture process. It is important to investigate further to ensure data accuracy and to identify the cause of this prolonged stasis in the attribute's state.
