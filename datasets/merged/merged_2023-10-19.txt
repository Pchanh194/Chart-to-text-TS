This prolonged consistency may indicate a potential anomaly in the data or a period of inactivity for the specific attribute. Subsequently, there is a sequence of state changes where the attribute transitions from 0.0 to 1.0 and then to -1.0, with intermittent periods of stability at each state. These abrupt changes in the attribute values could signify anomalies in the operation of the fan system, potentially requiring further investigation and analysis to understand the underlying causes.
Anomalies in the data can be observed in multiple timestamps where the fan_stat_G-06 attribute remains consistently at a value of 0.0 or 1.0 for an extended period of time. This is an anomaly as it indicates a lack of change in the fan status for a notably long duration, which may be unusual based on normal operating patterns. Specifically, there are periods where the fan status remains constant for longer than usual, such as from 2023/10/19-00:00:08 to 2023/10/19-06:40:08 when it remains at 0.0, and from 2023/10/19-07:00:08 to 2023/10/19-14:40:08 when it remains at 1.0. Additionally, there are instances where the attribute takes on unexpected values, such as the sudden switch from 1.0 to 0.0 at 2023/10/19-07:40:08. Moreover, the entry corresponding to a negative value at timestamp 2023/10/19-15:20:08 also raises concerns about data integrity. These anomalies may warrant further investigation into the underlying causes to understand and address these unexpected patterns in the fan status data.
The data shows fan status information with continuous readings of 0.0, transitioning to 1.0, and occasionally showing anomalies with a value of -1.0. Anomalies occur during specific time periods when the fan status deviates from the normal operating states (0 or 1), indicating potential issues with the fan or sensor. These anomalies occur intermittently and last for varying durations, suggesting potential irregularities or malfunctions that may need further investigation and maintenance to ensure consistent and reliable fan operation. 
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_G-08" remains at 0.0 for an extended period from 2023/10/19-00:00:08 to 2023/10/19-06:00:08, indicating that the fan status remains unchanged during this time. This can be considered an anomaly if the fan is expected to operate continuously within this time frame. Subsequently, there is a transition to a state of 1.0 from 2023/10/19-06:20:08 to 2023/10/19-08:40:08, where the fan maintains a constant status of 1.0. Another anomaly occurs when the fan status briefly changes to 0.0 from 2023/10/19-09:00:08 to 2023/10/19-09:40:09, only to switch back to 1.0 from 2023/10/19-10:00:09 to 2023/10/19-14:00:08. Further irregularities are observed from 2023/10/19-14:20:14 to 2023/10/19-15:40:08, with intermittent shifts between 0.0 and 1.0. Additionally, anomalous readings are noted at 2023/10/19-15:20:08 and 2023/10/19-16:20:08 where the value is recorded as -1.0.  These anomalies suggest potential issues with the fan system, variations in operating parameters, or data recording errors. Further investigation into the underlying causes of these deviations is warranted to ensure the proper functioning and accurate monitoring of the fan system.
The data indicates anomalies in the fan status attribute, as it remains at 0.0 consistently for an extended period. Additionally, the attribute abruptly transitions from 0.0 to -1.0 at a few timestamps. The fan status should typically vary between 0 and 1, reflecting the on/off states of the fan. The prolonged duration of the fan status being out of the setpoint range, and the sudden transitions to -1.0, signify irregularities in the fan's functioning compared to the expected behavior. It's essential to investigate these anomalies further to ensure the proper operation of the fan and address any underlying issues causing these deviations from the expected setpoint range.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-06" remains at 0.0 consistently for an extended period, specifically from 2023/10/19-00:00:08 to 2023/10/19-15:40:08. Following this duration, the attribute begins to fluctuate between 0.0 and -1.0, indicating a deviation from the standard states seen prior. This persistent span of a single state and subsequent deviation may suggest anomalies or potential issues with the system, specifically related to the fan's operational behavior. It is essential to investigate the reasons behind this extended unchanging state and subsequent erratic behavior to ensure the proper functioning of the system.
The given data represents the status of a fan over the span of a day. However, there are some anomalies in the data. From 07:20:08 to 08:00:08, the fan status changes from 0.0 to 1.0 and then back to 0.0, and then from 08:20:08 to 09:40:09, the status remains consistently at 1.0. After that, there are instances where the fan status abruptly changes from 1.0 to -1.0 at 15:20:08, 16:20:08, 17:20:08, and 18:20:09, indicating a sudden change in the fan's behavior. Despite these anomalies, the fan status eventually stabilizes around 0.0 from 18:40:08 onwards.  This data indicates some irregularities in the fan status, including sudden changes and periods of consistent states outside the expected range of values. These anomalies could potentially be due to various factors such as sensor errors, external disturbances, or actual changes in the fan's operational behavior. Further investigation into these anomalies is required to determine their precise cause and impact on the overall system.
The data shows a consistent trend of the attribute "fan_stat_L1-04" staying at a value of 0.0 from the timestamp 2023/10/19-00:00:08 to 2023/10/19-05:40:08, with no changes in its states. This extended period of time where the fan status remains unchanged might indicate a lack of variability or potential anomaly in the data collection or the fan system itself. Additionally, there are anomalies observed later in the data, where the fan status alternates between 1.0 and -1.0. These fluctuations could indicate inconsistencies in the fan operation and may warrant further investigation to ensure proper functionality and performance. It's essential to closely monitor and evaluate the fan system to identify and address any underlying issues that are causing the anomalies in the data.
It seems that the fan status (fan_stat_L1-03) was consistently at 1.0 for the majority of the day, indicating that the fan was continuously running during that period. However, there are several anomalies where the fan status abruptly changes to -1.0 and then returns to 1.0. These anomalies occur at 15:20:08, 16:20:08, 17:20:08, 18:20:09, and 23:20:08. These periods of sudden changes in the fan status suggest potential abnormalities or irregularities in the fan operation, which may require further investigation to ensure optimal functioning and energy efficiency.
This dataset records the status of a fan, with the values indicating whether the fan is off (0.0) or on (1.0). The dataset shows that the fan remained turned off consistently from 00:00:08 to 05:40:08 and then turned on consistently from 06:00:08 to 14:50:09. After that, the fan's status fluctuated, with a specific anomaly occurring when the fan's status unexpectedly transitioned to -1.0 at 15:20:08, 16:20:08, 17:20:08, and 18:20:09. These negative values are unusual and may indicate a potential data recording error. Additionally, the fan's status transitioned abruptly from 0.0 to 1.0 at 15:10:08, and at 16:10:08, these transitions could also indicate anomalies in the dataset. It's important to investigate these anomalies further to ensure data accuracy.
The provided data shows the status of a fan (fan_stat_L1-01) over a 24-hour period. The fan status is recorded with timestamps at 20-minute intervals. From the data, it is observed that the fan status remains at 0.0 (off) from 00:00:08 until 06:00:08, which is for a duration of 6 hours. This extended period of the fan remaining off could indicate a potential anomaly or a change in operating conditions. Following this, there is a consistent shift in the fan status to 1.0 (on) from 06:00:08 onwards, which again lasts for 6 hours. However, there are intermittent instances where the fan status fluctuates or shows a value of -1.0, an unexpected occurrence that is not aligned with the typical on/off states of the fan. These anomalies could be indicative of potential malfunctions or irregularities in the fan operation, warranting further investigation and potentially corrective actions to ensure proper functioning.
