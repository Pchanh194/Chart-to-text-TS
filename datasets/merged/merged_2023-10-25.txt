The provided data represents the status of a fan (fan_stat_L1-03) over a 24-hour period on October 25, 2023. The status is indicated with values of 1.0 and -1.0, where 1.0 likely denotes the fan being on and -1.0 denotes the fan being off. Upon initial inspection, several anomalies stand out, particularly with the consistent nature of the fan's state. The fan appears to maintain the same status for extended periods, which may indicate a potential issue or anomaly in the fan's operations. This anomaly is highlighted by the persistence of the same status, which could potentially indicate a malfunction or lack of responsiveness to changes in environmental conditions. Additionally, the continuous status timeline suggests that the fan may not be adjusting to the required setpoint range or may be experiencing technical difficulties. Further investigation and monitoring may be warranted to assess and rectify the anomalies observed in the data.
