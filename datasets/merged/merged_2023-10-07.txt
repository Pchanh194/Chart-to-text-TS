The data for attribute 'fan_stat_G-05' shows a consistent state of 0 throughout the given timestamps from 2023/10/07-00:29:22 to 2023/10/07-18:02:21. This extended duration of unchanged state might indicate an anomaly in the data, as it is uncommon for the fan status to remain constant for such a long period of time. It is recommended to verify the data collection process and sensor functionality for any potential issues or errors that could be leading to this anomalous behavior. Additionally, it's important to check whether the fan is actually supposed to remain off for this extended duration or if there's a discrepancy between the recorded data and the actual operational status.
The provided data shows a consistent status of 0 for the attribute "fan_stat_G-06" over the course of the day, indicating that the fan associated with this attribute did not change its state. This prolonged period of inactivity could be considered an anomaly, especially if the fan is expected to operate within this timeframe. It's important to investigate the potential causes of this extended period of dormancy, as it may point to underlying issues with the fan's functionality. Additionally, there are no fluctuations in the temperature within the dataset, as the attribute related to temperature is not provided. Anomalies such as these can provide crucial insights for maintenance and operational adjustments to ensure the proper functioning of equipment and environment regulation.
Based on the data provided, there is an anomaly in the fan_stat_G-07 attribute, which remains at a constant state of 0 for an extended period of time. From 00:29:22 to 18:02:21, the attribute does not change its state. This prolonged duration of the attribute being consistently at 0 may indicate a potential issue with the fan or the monitoring system itself. It's recommended to investigate this anomaly further to determine the cause and take any necessary corrective actions to ensure proper functioning.
The data indicates a consistent anomaly in the fan status (fan_stat_G-08) attribute, as it repeatedly maintains a state of 0 throughout the recorded time period. This anomaly extends for a substantial duration, spanning multiple hours without any change in state. Such sustained periods of inactivity are noteworthy and may warrant further investigation to ascertain the cause of this extended deviation from the expected range of states. It is evident that the fan_stat_G-08 attribute remains outside the setpoint range for an extended period, indicating a potential issue or abnormal behavior in the system.
The data shows a consistent anomaly where the fan_stat_L1-07 attribute remains at 0 for an extended period from 00:29:22 to 18:02:21 on October 7th, 2023. This prolonged duration of the attribute being at 0 could indicate an issue with the fan or the monitoring system, as typically there should be some variability in this attribute. Further investigation into the fan's functionality and the monitoring equipment may be necessary to address this anomaly and ensure proper system operation.
The data shows a consistent state of 0 for the fan_stat_L1-06 attribute from 2023/10/07-00:29:22 up to 2023/10/07-18:02:21. There seems to be no change in the state of the attribute throughout this time period, indicating a potential anomaly in the data. Such prolonged periods of a steady state, particularly in an operational attribute like fan_stat_L1-06, should be investigated further to ensure that there are no underlying issues affecting the system. It's important to consider potential data recording issues or actual operational concerns that might explain this extended period of unchanged state.
It appears that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-05" remains consistently at 0 throughout the entire dataset from 2023/10/07-00:29:22 to 2023/10/07-18:02:21. This prolonged period of no change or variability in the attribute may indicate an anomaly or potential issue in the data collection process or the device being monitored. It's essential to investigate further to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
The provided data from October 7, 2023, depicts a consistent state of 0 for the fan_stat_L1-04 attribute, indicating that the fan associated with this attribute remained inactive throughout the day. This sustained state of inactivity for the fan is an anomaly as it is unusual for the fan to remain inactive without any state changes for such a prolonged period. The fan_stat_L1-04 attribute exhibited a sustained period of zero state for approximately 18 hours spanning from 00:29:22 to 18:02:21, signifying an extended duration of inactivity beyond the expected operational parameters. This anomaly warrants further investigation to determine the underlying cause of the prolonged inactivity and to address any potential issues affecting the fan's functionality.
The data from the fan_stat_L1-03 attribute shows a consistent state of 1 (presumably indicating the fan is active) from 00:29:22 to 18:02:21 on October 7th, 2023. This prolonged period of the fan being continuously active raises the possibility of anomalies or potential inefficiencies in the cooling system. While a constant state of 1 for the fan may not necessarily indicate an anomaly, it's worth investigating whether the system is responding optimally to temperature changes, especially considering the absence of any state change during this timeframe. Monitoring the setpoint range for temperature (20-24 degrees Celsius) alongside the constant fan activity could also provide insights into the system's performance and potential anomalies that may require attention.
The provided data shows a consistent and continuous "fan_stat_L1-02" attribute reading of 0 over the course of the day, from 2023/10/07-00:29:22 to 2023/10/07-18:02:21. This prolonged duration of the attribute remaining at 0 could be considered anomalous as there are no fluctuations or changes in state within the dataset. It's unusual for the attribute to remain constant for such an extended period, suggesting a potential issue with the sensor or the data collection process. This anomaly spans approximately 17 hours and 33 minutes, indicating a prolonged period of stationary readings, which warrants further investigation to determine the cause and address any underlying issues.
The data shows a consistent state of the fan_stat_L1-01 attribute being at 1 from 00:29:22 to 12:39:49 on October 7, 2023. This is an extended period of 12 hours and 10 minutes where the attribute remains unchanged. However, at 12:39:49, there is a sudden change to 0, remaining in this state until the end of the recorded data at 18:02:21. This change can be considered an anomaly, as it deviates from the consistent state over the previous hours. It would be important to investigate the reason behind this sudden change in the fan_stat_L1-01 attribute, as it could indicate a potential issue or event that affected the system.
