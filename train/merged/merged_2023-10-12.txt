The temperature data shows a consistent anomaly starting from 2023/10/12-00:00:13, where the temperature reading remains constant at 11.3 degrees Celsius until 2023/10/12-16:19:52. This prolonged period of consistent temperature readings suggests a potential sensor malfunction or a frozen reading, as the temperature should exhibit natural fluctuations over time. Furthermore, there is a drastic anomaly where the temperature reading drops to -1.0 degrees Celsius, which is highly improbable and indicates a clear sensor error. This data presents conspicuous anomalies that may require immediate investigation and potential recalibration of the temperature sensor to ensure accurate and reliable readings.
It appears that there are some anomalies in the temperature data for October 12, 2023. The temperature stays consistently below the setpoint range of 20-24 degrees Celsius for a considerable amount of time, ranging from 00:35:17 to 14:20:11. There is also a significant anomaly at 13:22:15, where the temperature is recorded as -1.0 degrees Celsius, which is likely a data recording error or equipment malfunction. These anomalies indicate potential issues with temperature regulation or data recording that may need further investigation to ensure accurate and reliable temperature control systems.
The temperature data shows some anomalies that are worth noting. At several time points, the dew_temp_L1-07 attribute deviates from the typical range of 20-24 degrees Celsius. Specifically, beginning at 2023/10/12-00:35:17, the temperature falls below the lower limit, reaching 10.9 degrees Celsius. It continues to fluctuate between 10.7 and 11.7 degrees Celsius for an extended period, with the most significant anomaly occurring at 2023/10/12-13:22:15, where an invalid value of -1.0 degrees Celsius is recorded. This indicates a potential data quality issue that should be investigated further. Additionally, the temperature remains consistently low for several hours from 2023/10/12-05:32:53 to 2023/10/12-16:19:52, suggesting a prolonged deviation from the normal operating conditions. These anomalies could impact the system's performance and should be addressed to ensure accurate monitoring and control.

This anomaly persists through several subsequent readings before returning to the expected value range. The attribute's deviation from its standard states and the duration of this anomaly may warrant further investigation to understand its implications for the system it monitors.
There are some anomalies in the fan status data for October 12, 2023. The fan status remains at 0.0 for a prolonged period from 00:00:13 to 16:19:52, which indicates that the fan did not change its state for approximately 16 hours. However, there is an aberration at 13:18:15 where the fan status registers as -1.0, which is unexpected as it falls outside the normal binary states of 0 or 1. This anomaly lasted for approximately 15 minutes before returning to the normal state of 0.0. The extended period of constant fan status and the sudden deviation to an unexpected value both warrant further investigation to understand the underlying reasons for these anomalies.
The data shows some anomalies in the attribute "fan_stat_G-03." The attribute remains at 0.0 from 00:00:13 to 16:19:52, which is an unusually long duration. This could indicate a potential issue with the data recording or the fan system itself. Additionally, there are abrupt changes from -1.0 to 1.0 at 13:18:15, with subsequent consistent 1.0 values. This sudden transition followed by consistent values may indicate a potential anomaly in the fan status. It is recommended to further investigate these anomalies to ensure proper functioning of the fan system and data recording processes.
