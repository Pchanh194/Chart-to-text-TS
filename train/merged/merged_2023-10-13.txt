Additionally, there is an instance where the fan status is recorded as -1.0, which is not within the expected range of 0 or 1. This could be an erroneous data entry or an indication of a malfunction in the fan system that needs further investigation. These anomalies highlight the importance of monitoring and addressing potential issues in the fan system to ensure optimal performance and environmental conditions.
The data shows that the fan status (fan_stat_G-04) remains at 0.0 for most of the day, indicating a consistent state of the fan. However, there is an anomaly at 13:34:00 where the fan status abruptly changes to -1.0. This anomaly indicates a deviation from the expected behavior and may require investigation to understand why the fan status moved to a different state. It's important to note that the fan status remained out of the expected range (0 or 1) for a significant duration from 13:34:00 onwards. Further analysis is recommended to identify the root cause of this anomaly and to ensure the proper functioning of the fan.
The data for fan_stat_G-05 on October 13, 2023, shows a consistent state of 0.0 for most of the day, with a sudden anomaly at 13:34:00 where the state changes to -1.0, deviating from the expected 0 or 1 values. This anomaly persists for a single timestamp before returning to the expected range, resulting in a brief deviation from the setpoint range. It's important to investigate the reason behind this outlier and its impact on the overall system.  It's worth noting that the attribute remains out of the expected range for just one timestamp, indicating a transient anomaly rather than a sustained deviation. Further monitoring and analysis can reveal the cause of such abrupt changes and help in addressing any potential issues.
From the provided data, it is evident that there are anomalies in the fan_stat_G-06 attribute. The data shows that for an extended period, the state of the fan remains at 0.0 before transitioning to 1.0 for a brief period and then abruptly to -1.0, which is unusual as the expected states are usually 0 or 1. This anomaly continues as the state remains at -1.0, which is outside the expected setpoint range. Subsequently, it transitions back to 0.0 and later to 1.0, with no change in states for extended durations. These anomalies indicate potential issues or irregularities in the fan behavior, which would require further investigation to ensure optimal functioning and compliance with the expected setpoint range.
The data shows a consistent fan status of 0.0 for most of the entries, which indicates that the fan remained off during those times. However, there are a couple of anomalies worth noting. Firstly, at Timestamp 2023/10/13-09:32:31, the fan status abruptly changes to 1.0, indicating that the fan suddenly turned on. This deviation from the typical pattern of the fan being off could be indicative of an unexpected event or change in conditions. Additionally, at Timestamp 2023/10/13-13:34:00, the fan status is recorded as -1.0, which is outside the expected range of 0 or 1. This anomaly could be a data error or may signify a malfunction in the fan status sensor. Overall, these anomalies are important to investigate further as they deviate from the expected behavior of the fan system.
The data shows anomalies in the behavior of the fan_stat_G-08 attribute. Specifically, there are instances where the attribute value falls outside the expected range or exhibits unexpected behavior. For example, there is a period of time (from 2023/10/13-13:34:00 to 2023/10/13-00:15:34) where the attribute value is registered as -1.0, which may indicate a data recording error or an abnormal state. Additionally, there are periods of time where the attribute remains unchanged, indicating a lack of variability in its states. These anomalies highlight the need for further investigation into the data collection process and potential issues with the fan system.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-07" remains at a constant value of 0.0 for a significant portion of the day on October 13, 2023. However, a notable anomaly occurs at 13:34:00 when the attribute abruptly changes to -1.0 before returning to 0.0. This anomaly lasts for a short duration but could indicate a potential issue or irregularity in the system. It's important to investigate further to understand the cause of this sudden change and ensure the proper functioning of the equipment.
The data shows consistent readings of fan_stat_L1-06 at 0.0 for most of the timestamps, indicating the fan status remains unchanged during those periods. However, there is an anomaly at Timestamp 2023/10/13-13:34:00 where the fan_stat_L1-06 value is recorded as -1.0, which is outside the expected range of 0 or 1. This anomaly persists for an extended period until the next recorded timestamp. It's important to investigate this anomaly further to understand the cause and potential impact on the system.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-05" predominantly remains at 0.0, indicating a consistent state of the fan. However, a notable anomaly occurs at 2023/10/13-13:34:00 when the attribute value drops to -1.0, deviating from its usual state. This anomaly persists for at least until the next recorded timestamp. It's important to investigate this anomaly further to understand the reason behind the unusual behavior of the fan status, as it may indicate a potential issue with the fan or the monitoring system.
Anomalies in the data can be observed at specific timestamps. For instance, from 2023/10/13 00:00:14 to 2023/10/13 09:32:31, the attribute "fan_stat_L1-04" remains at 0.0, indicating that the fan was inactive during this time period. This extended duration of inactivity could signify an abnormal operational pattern, potentially leading to inadequate ventilation or cooling. Additionally, at 2023/10/13 13:34:00, the attribute "fan_stat_L1-04" unexpectedly takes on a value of -1.0, which is outside the expected range of 0 or 1. Such anomalies may warrant further investigation to ensure the proper functioning and control of the fan system.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-03" remains consistently at 1.0 for the majority of the entries, indicating that the fan status is consistently on. However, there is one anomaly where the attribute value switches to -1.0 at "2023/10/13-13:34:00". This anomaly lasts for a single entry, suggesting a transient fluctuation before returning to the previous state. This anomaly deviates from the expected behavior and could potentially indicate a data recording error or an unusual event affecting the fan status. Further investigation may be necessary to understand the cause of this anomaly and its impact.
The data shows anomalies in the fan status attribute (fan_stat_L1-02) on October 13, 2023. The fan status remains at 0.0 for an extended period, from the initial timestamp at 00:00:14 until 09:32:31, which is approximately 9.5 hours. This extended duration of the fan status not changing to 1.0 or fluctuating within the setpoint range suggests a potential anomaly in the system. Additionally, there's an anomaly at 13:34:00, where the fan_stat_L1-02 data is recorded as -1.0, which is unexpected and could indicate a data recording error or a system malfunction. Further investigation is recommended to understand the cause of the anomalies and to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system.
In the provided data, there are several anomalies observed in the "fan_stat_L1-01" attribute readings. Anomalies are detected by sudden shifts or persistent states that deviate from the norm. The attribute remains at 0.0 for an extended period, from Timestamp 2023/10/13-00:00:14 to 2023/10/13-08:17:51. This prolonged consistent state could indicate a potential issue, as the fan may not have been functioning as intended during this period. Furthermore, at Timestamp 2023/10/13-13:34:00, an anomalous value of -1.0 is recorded, which is unexpected and may require further investigation. It is important to monitor these anomalies closely to ensure the proper functioning of the system and to address any potential issues promptly.
