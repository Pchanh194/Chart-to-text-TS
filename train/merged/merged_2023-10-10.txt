An extended period of unchanged state could suggest a potential problem with the fan or the monitoring equipment. Further investigation is recommended to ensure the system's functionality and to address any anomalies in the data.
The data indicates a consistent anomaly in the fan status attribute (fan_stat_L1-05) as it remains at 0 for the entire duration of the timestamps provided (from 13:17:54 to 17:40:32 on October 10, 2023). This extended period of the attribute being consistently at 0 may indicate a potential issue with the fan or the sensor monitoring its status. It would be advisable to investigate further to determine the cause of this anomaly and to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system.
In the provided data, the "fan_stat_L1-04" attribute shows anomalies in its state changes. Specifically, from 13:17:54 to 17:17:28, the attribute remains in the state "1" continuously for approximately 4 hours, indicating a deviation from the expected state changes. This prolonged duration of consistent state without any change could signify a potential anomaly or irregular behavior in the system. Additionally, at 17:40:32, there is a change in the state to "0", resulting in a sudden transition from the previous consistent state "1". Such abrupt changes can be indicative of irregular behavior and may require further investigation to understand the underlying reasons for these anomalies.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-03" remains at a constant value of 1 throughout the entire duration of the recorded timestamps on 10th October 2023. This lack of variability or change in state for the fan status over several hours may indicate an anomaly or potential issue in the system. It is unusual for the fan state to remain unchanged for such an extended period, suggesting there could be a malfunction or a lack of responsiveness in the fan control system. This anomaly should be investigated to ensure the proper functioning of the fan and to identify any underlying issues leading to the prolonged consistent state.
The data shows a consistent fan status of 1 from 13:17:54 to 17:40:32 on October 10th, 2023. This period of unchanged fan status signifies the anomaly that the fan remained in an active state for an extended duration without transitioning to the inactive state (status 0). This prolonged duration of continuous fan operation may indicate a potential issue, such as system malfunction or failure to comply with the setpoint range for temperature control. It is advisable to investigate and address this anomaly to ensure the appropriate functioning of the fan system and adherence to the setpoint range (20-24 degrees Celsius for temperature).
In the provided data, the attribute "fan_stat_L1-01" remains at state 1 (indicating the fan is on) consistently throughout the listed timestamps. There are no instances where the state changes to 0 or where it falls outside the setpoint range, which is typical behavior for the fan. This suggests that the fan is functioning normally and maintaining a constant state of operation within the specified time range. No anomalies or deviations from the expected behavior are observed in the data.
