The provided data shows the dew_temp_L1-06 attribute readings over a 24-hour period on October 29, 2023. Upon reviewing the data, several anomalies can be observed. Firstly, the attribute consistently remains below the lower setpoint range of 20 degrees Celsius, reaching -1.0 degrees Celsius multiple times throughout the day. This sustained deviation from the setpoint range indicates a potential issue with the temperature control system or sensor. Furthermore, it's important to note that the attribute doesn't change states between 0 and 1, as it continuously remains in a sub-zero state. This prolonged duration of anomalies suggests a persistent problem in maintaining the attribute within the desired range, warranting further investigation to address the underlying issue.
The data shows that the attribute "dew_temp_L1-07" remains consistently below the setpoint range of 20-24 degrees Celsius throughout the entire day. Specifically, the temperature starts at 15.1 degrees Celsius and gradually decreases to as low as 14.6 degrees Celsius before reaching the extreme anomaly at -1.0 degrees Celsius. This substantial negative anomaly is highly unusual and may indicate a malfunction in the sensor or a data recording error. It is important to investigate and rectify this anomaly as soon as possible. Additionally, the data also shows consistent anomalies with a reading of -1.0 degrees Celsius at various timestamps throughout the day, indicating a prolonged period of unexpected sensor behavior. Further investigation and maintenance are necessary to address these anomalies and ensure accurate temperature monitoring within the desired setpoint range.

These anomalies in the temperature data indicate potential malfunctions or abnormal conditions in the environment being monitored. Further investigation into the data integrity and environmental conditions would be crucial to address and rectify these anomalies.
I have analyzed the data and found anomalies in the fan status (fan_stat_G-01). The fan status remained at -1.0 for a significant duration, indicating that the fan was not in its normal operating state. Specifically, the fan status remained outside the setpoint range (0 or 1) for an extended period of time, from timestamps 2023/10/29 01:20:09 to 2023/10/29 05:20:08, 2023/10/29 06:40:09 to 2023/10/29 10:00:09, 2023/10/29 11:40:09 to 2023/10/29 15:00:09, and 2023/10/29 16:40:09 to 2023/10/29 20:00:09. These prolonged deviations from the normal operating conditions should be investigated to ensure the proper functioning and performance of the fan system.
Upon analyzing the data, I've noticed a consistent anomaly related to the fan_stat_G-02 attribute. It appears that at regular intervals, the attribute takes on the value of -1.0 and then returns to 0.0. This pattern persists throughout the entire dataset, indicating a consistent anomaly in the behavior of the fan_stat_G-02 attribute. The duration for which the attribute remains at -1.0 varies, but it consistently perturbs the expected range of 0.0. Further investigation into the root cause of this anomaly is advisable to ensure the proper functioning of the system and to maintain adherence to the setpoint range.
The data provided consists of timestamps and the corresponding control values for a fan status attribute. The fan status data shows a majority of periods with no change in the attribute's value, only exhibiting a few instances when the value is -1.0. These instances could represent anomalies or potential issues with the fan's operation, as the value is not within the expected range of 0.0 or 1.0. Moreover, the attribute does not change its states (0 or 1) consistently, potentially indicating operational irregularities. The duration of the anomalies appears to be sporadic throughout the data timeline. Further analysis and investigation are warranted to ascertain the root cause of these anomalies and ensure the proper functioning of the fan system.

These anomalies suggest potential equipment malfunctions or irregular operational behavior. Further investigation is recommended to address these deviations and ensure the proper functioning of the system.
Upon analyzing the data, it appears that there are several anomalies observed in the fan status data. Particularly, there are instances where the fan status remains at -1.0 for an extended period of time relative to the regular intervals. The fan status ideally should fluctuate between 0.0 and 1.0 in normal operating conditions. Hence, the prolonged duration of fan status at -1.0 suggests a potential issue, warranting investigation into the functionality and operational stability of the fan system during those time intervals. This anomaly should be reviewed to ensure the proper functioning and maintenance of the fan system.
