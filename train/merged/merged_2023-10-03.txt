This prolonged period of the attribute being at the same state may indicate a potential anomaly in the system. Subsequently, from `2023/10/03-06:23:30` to `2023/10/03-09:54:49`, the attribute remains at 1 for around 3 hours and 31 minutes, which could also be considered an anomaly. These consistent states for extended durations might be worth investigating for any underlying issues in the data collection process or the system being monitored.
This data shows a consistent state of "0" for the attribute "fan_stat_L1-07" over a 24-hour period from 2023/10/03-00:08:19 to 2023/10/03-23:42:11. This suggests that the fan associated with this attribute did not change its state throughout the day. The lack of variance or change within the data can be considered an anomaly, especially if the fan is expected to operate within this time frame. Further investigation is advisable to clarify whether this lack of change is due to an actual absence of activity or if there may be a data collection issue or sensor malfunction. If the fan should have been operating during this time, then the prolonged absence of any state change could signify a potential issue with the fan or its monitoring system.

It is important to investigate the data collection process and the integrity of the fan status attribute to ensure accurate and meaningful data analysis.
The provided data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-05" remains at a value of 0 consistently throughout the day and only transitions to a value of 1 at 07:11:37, and remains in this state for several hours until 08:46:05. Generally, the attribute stays within the 0 state, with no other significant changes observed. This behavior may indicate a prolonged period of inactivity or a specific operational pattern for the fan unit represented by "fan_stat_L1-05." The extended duration of the attribute remaining in the 1 state from 07:11:37 to 08:46:05 could suggest abnormal or unplanned usage of the fan during that time period. Further investigation may be needed to understand the reasons behind these anomalies and their potential impact on the overall system.
The provided data includes a timestamp and the status of a fan (fan_stat_L1-04) at various time intervals. An anomaly was observed from 2023/10/03-06:23:30 to 2023/10/03-19:06:21, where the fan status remained at a single state ('1' denoting on) continuously for approximately 12 hours and 43 minutes. This prolonged period of constant fan status may indicate a potential issue with the fan or its control system, which should be investigated further to ensure proper functioning and energy efficiency. Additionally, after this long period of constant status, there seems to be intermittent changes in the fan status between '1' and '0' in the subsequent records. This oscillation in the fan state could indicate possible instability or irregular operation, warranting attention to prevent any operational disruptions.
The data for the attribute "fan_stat_L1-03" indicates a consistent state of 1, with no change observed throughout the entire day of October 3rd, 2023. This suggests that the fan associated with this attribute remained in operation continuously without any variation in its status. While this consistent state may not be indicative of an anomaly per se, it could warrant further investigation to ensure that the fan is functioning as intended and to understand the reasons for the sustained operation without any state change.  It's important to note that without additional contextual information, it's unclear whether this consistent state is normal for the fan in question or if it may indicate an anomaly or issue with the fan's control system. Further analysis and contextual understanding are essential to determine the significance of this sustained state.
The provided data shows consistent readings of the attribute "fan_stat_L1-02" with a value of 0 throughout the entire day of October 3rd, 2023.
