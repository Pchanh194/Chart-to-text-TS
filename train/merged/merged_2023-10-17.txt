The provided data indicates anomalies in the fan status attribute (fan_stat_L1-01). Notably, there are instances where the fan status remains -1.0 persistently for a long duration, notably from 00:20:08 to 06:00:08. It then transitions abruptly to 1.0 at 06:00:08 and remains so for an extended period. Such prolonged duration of the fan status being outside the expected range suggests potential anomalies or issues with the fan system. Additionally, it's noticeable that there are sudden changes in fan status from -1.0 to 1.0 from 06:00:08 to 09:00:08, indicating abrupt changes in the fan operation. Such erratic behavior may warrant further investigation to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system.

From 00:20:08 to 22:30:13, the fan status remains consistent at -1.0, indicating that the fan is continuously in an abnormal state. This extended duration of consistent abnormal readings might signify a potential issue with the fan or the sensor capturing the data. Moreover, there are sporadic instances when the fan status changes to 1.0 before returning to -1.0, suggesting potential fluctuations in the anomaly. It's crucial to investigate the root cause of these anomalies to ensure the proper functioning of the system the fan is regulating.
There are several anomalies in the data concerning the `fan_stat_G-02` attribute. One notable anomaly is the extended duration where the attribute remains at a value of -1.0 from `2023/10/17-00:20:08` to `2023/10/17-07:30:08`, a duration of over 7 hours.

Additionally, there are sporadic instances where the attribute abruptly changes from 0.0 to -1.0, such as at `2023/10/17-07:40:08`. These sudden shifts in the attribute may suggest irregularities in the system and may require further investigation to ensure proper functioning.
The provided data shows anomalies in the behavior of the attribute "fan_stat_G-03." Specifically, from timestamps 2023/10/17-00:20:08 to 2023/10/17-07:40:08, the fan_stat_G-03 attribute remains at -1.0 without changing its state or value. This prolonged period of unchanged state indicates a potential anomaly in the system or sensor recording the fan status. Later on, from timestamps 2023/10/17-07:00:08 to 2023/10/17-09:40:08, the fan_stat_G-03 attribute experiences rapid state changes between 1.0 and -1.0 within short intervals, which could be indicative of abnormal behavior in the cooling or ventilation system. Lastly, there are additional anomalies after the timestamp 2023/10/17-18:00:09, where the fan_stat_G-03 attribute remains at 0.0 for an extended period without any state changes. This prolonged period of the attribute being unchanged may indicate an issue with the recording or the fan system itself. These anomalies warrant further investigation to ensure the proper functioning of the ventilation or cooling system.
The data indicates that the attribute "fan_stat_G-04" experiences anomalies where it moves outside the setpoint range (0 or 1) or does not change its state for extended periods. Specifically, between the timestamp 2023/10/17-00:20:08 and 2023/10/17-13:40:08, the fan_stat_G-04 value remains outside the setpoint range and unchanged at -1.0.
