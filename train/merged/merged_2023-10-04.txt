Further investigation would be necessary to determine the cause of this anomaly and whether any action is required.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_G-02" remains at a constant value of 0 for an extended period from 2023/10/04-00:05:12 to 2023/10/04-13:46:44. This prolonged duration of the attribute staying at 0 could be considered an anomaly, especially if it deviates from the expected behavior or setpoint range. However, a notable change occurs at 2023/10/04-13:46:44 when the attribute abruptly changes to 1, indicating a significant deviation from the previous pattern. Additionally, from 2023/10/04-16:04:57 to 2023/10/04-17:59:48, there are consecutive instances where the attribute switches back-and-forth between 0 and 1, which also represents anomalous behavior. It's important to investigate these anomalies further to understand the underlying cause and potential impact on the system.
The provided data consists of timestamps and the state of a fan (fan_stat_G-03), represented as either 0 or 1. The fan status remains at 0 consistently from 00:05:12 to 21:49:33 on 2023/10/04, indicating a prolonged period of inactivity. The anomaly occurs when the fan status changes from 0 to 1 at 06:48:34, remaining in the 1 state until the end of the recorded period. This shift in the state of the fan represents an anomaly, as it deviates from the previously observed pattern of continuous inactivity.  It's important to investigate the reasons behind the change in the fan state, as it may indicate an unexpected event or malfunction. A sustained period of inactivity followed by a sudden change in state signals a potential anomaly that could impact the system's performance or indicate a breakdown. Further analysis and monitoring of the fan's behavior are advised to ensure the system's optimal functioning and prevent potential issues.
The provided data contains a continuous log of the "fan_stat_G-04" attribute, indicating a constant value of 0 across the entire dataset. This anomaly persists for 23 hours and 39 minutes, as indicated by the timestamps. Such a prolonged duration of unchanged state could indicate a potential issue with the sensor, measurement equipment, or the fan itself. It is essential to investigate and potentially rectify this anomaly to ensure accurate data monitoring and system functionality.
The data from 2023/10/04 shows a consistent attribute state of 0 for the fan_stat_G-05 throughout the entire day. This persistent state outside of the expected setpoint range could indicate either an anomaly in the data recording process, potential sensor malfunction, or an operational issue with the fan system. Given the data's consistent pattern, it is crucial to investigate the root cause of this anomaly to ensure the proper functioning of the system and maintain a comfortable setpoint range for temperature regulation.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_G-06" remained at a state of 0 for an extended period from 00:05:12 to 10:42:54 but then transitioned to a state of 1 and maintained this state until 17:36:49. Thereafter, it returned to a state of 0 and continued in this state until the end of the data at 23:44:29. This extended duration of maintaining a single state, without any fluctuations, could be considered an anomaly. It's worth investigating whether this extended period of constant state aligns with expected system behavior or if it indicates a potential issue within the system.
The data for the fan status (fan_stat_G-07) shows that the fan remained at a constant state of 0 for the entire duration of the day, from 00:05:12 to 23:44:29. This indicates that the fan did not change its state throughout the entire time period, which could be an anomaly. Typically, a fan's status might change in response to temperature changes or other factors, but seeing no change in state could be indicative of a potential issue with the sensor or the fan itself. It's worth investigating further to ensure that the fan is functioning as expected and that there are no underlying issues causing it to remain in a constant state.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_G-08" remains at 0 for a prolonged period of time, from 2023/10/04-00:05:12 to 2023/10/04-18:22:54, which is a total of approximately 18 hours and 17 minutes. Such an extended duration of the attribute staying at 0 could indicate an anomaly in the system, potentially suggesting a malfunction or an unusual operating condition. It would be essential to investigate the cause of this extended period with the attribute at 0 to ensure the proper functioning of the system and to address any underlying issues.
The data for the fan status (L1-07) on October 4th, 2023, indicates a consistent state of 0 throughout the entire day. This suggests that there were no instances of the fan turning on during this period. This extended period of inactivity for the fan could represent an anomaly, potentially indicating a lack of need for cooling or ventilation during this time. Monitoring a fan status persistently at 0 for an entire day may prompt an investigation into the environmental conditions and system operations to ensure proper functioning and energy efficiency.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-06" remains at value 0 consistently throughout the entire day of October 4th, 2023. This does indicate an anomaly as it suggests that the fan associated with "fan_stat_L1-06" did not change its state at any point during the day. Such an extended period of no change in state might indicate a potential issue with the fan or a data collection error. It's important to investigate further to ensure that the fan is functioning properly and that the data reflects the actual status of the fan.
The data shows a consistent value of 0 for the attribute "fan_stat_L1-05" throughout the entire day of October 4th, 2023. This flat line of 0 indicates that the fan status did not change from its initial state for the entire 24-hour period. This could represent a potential anomaly, as it is unusual for a fan to maintain a single status without any changes for an extended period. It's important to investigate whether there was a data recording issue or if there is an actual problem with the fan system's functionality. Further analysis and validation are recommended to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.
The data shows that the attribute "fan_stat_L1-04" remains at a constant state of 0 from 2023/10/04-00:05:12 to 2023/10/04-18:22:54, which is approximately 18 hours and 18 minutes. This extended period of a constant state may indicate a potential anomaly or issue with the sensor or fan system. It's unusual for the fan to remain off for such a long duration without any change in its state. The absence of any variation in the fan's status for an extended period could suggest a malfunction, control system failure, or a lack of response to environmental conditions. Further investigation and possibly maintenance or recalibration of the fan system may be necessary to address this anomaly and ensure proper functionality.
The data provided shows a continuous state of 1 for the attribute "fan_stat_L1-03" throughout the entire day of October 4th, 2023. There are no fluctuations or changes in state observed in the dataset. This could be an indication of a potential anomaly, as usually, there would be variations in the state of the fan, particularly in response to environmental conditions. The continuous state of 1 without any changes or transitions may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or the data recording process, and further investigation may be required to understand the root cause of this anomaly.
The data indicates that the fan status (fan_stat_L1-02) remained at a constant value of 0 throughout the entire day of October 4th, 2023. This anomaly suggests that there may be an issue with the sensor or data recording equipment, as it is unlikely for the fan status to remain unchanged for such an extended period of time. This outlier in the dataset could potentially be due to a malfunction or lack of data capture, and it is essential to investigate and rectify the issue to ensure accurate monitoring and control of the fan system.
From the provided time series data for the fan status, it is observed that the fan status stays at 0 for a prolonged period from 00:05:12 to 21:03:35, which indicates a deviation from the normal pattern of fan states. This extended duration of the fan being turned off could be an anomaly and might require attention. After this extended period, the fan status changes to 1 and remains in that state until the end of the time series, which could be indicative of the fan being constantly in use during that time. This deviation from the usual pattern may signify a potential issue with the fan's functionality or could provide insights regarding any unusual environmental conditions. Further investigation into the operational and environmental factors during this deviation could provide valuable insights for addressing any potential anomalies or optimizing the system's performance.
