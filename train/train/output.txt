Specifically, at 2023/10/31-00:20:08, 2023/10/31-01:20:08, 2023/10/31-02:20:09, 2023/10/31-03:20:08, 2023/10/31-04:20:09, 2023/10/31-05:20:09, 2023/10/31-06:10:14, 2023/10/31-08:50:09, 2023/10/31-09:50:10, 2023/10/31-10:50:09, 2023/10/31-11:50:09, 2023/10/31-12:50:09, 2023/10/31-13:50:13, 2023/10/31-14:50:09, 2023/10/31-15:50:09, 2023/10/31-16:50:09, 2023/10/31-17:50:09, 2023/10/31-18:50:09, and 2023/10/31-23:50:09.  During these periods, the fan_stat_L1-03 attribute exhibits values that fall outside the expected setpoint range of -1.0 to 1.0. It is out of range for approximately 20 minutes in each instance. These anomalies may indicate potential issues with the fan or the monitoring system, and further investigation is required to pinpoint the root cause of these deviations from the expected range.
The provided data shows irregularities in the fan status attribute. Specifically, there are several instances where the fan status remains at -1.0 for prolonged periods, deviating from the usual 0.0 and 1.0 states. These anomalies occur around the timestamps of 2023/10/31-00:20:08, 2023/10/31-01:20:08, 2023/10/31-02:20:09, 2023/10/31-03:20:08, and others, where the fan status holds at -1.0 for an extended duration, suggesting a potential malfunction or abnormal behavior in the system. Monitoring and investigating these anomalies is important to ensure the proper functioning of the fan system and to address any underlying issues that may be causing these extended deviations from the normal states.
It appears that there are anomalies in the data, particularly in the "fan_stat_L1-01" attribute. One anomaly is that the fan status value falls outside the expected range of 0 or 1. For instance, at Timestamp 2023/10/31-00:20:08, the fan status records a value of -1.0, which is unexpected as the status should ideally be 0 or 1. Similarly, there are anomalies at Timestamps 2023/10/31-01:20:08, 2023/10/31-02:20:09, and several other instances, where the value deviates from the expected 0-1 range.  In addition, there are prolonged periods where the fan status does not change, reflecting a consistent state rather than the expected fluctuations. For example, between Timestamps 2023/10/31-03:00:09 and 2023/10/31-06:00:09, the fan status remains at 0.0 without any change. This could be an indication of potential data recording issues or a period of system inactivity.  These anomalies could suggest potential issues with the fan monitoring system or data recording process, warranting a closer inspection to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the fan status data.
